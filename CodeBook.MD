The process involves developing an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Variables:
The 'tidy-data.txt' includes following variables
